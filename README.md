Blockchain Social Media are decentralized networking platforms built using blockchain protocols/platforms that allow the development of applications and smart contracts. To name a few, Ethereum, Steem, Stellar are some of the blockchain protocols that support the development of social media dApps. Being decentralized, Blockchain social media networks are not under any central proprietary authority holding all the data. Rather, the data gets stored in a homogenous and decentralized manner across servers of each node of the network. Blockchain-based social media platforms support social networking, content sharing, and even blogging, but being decentralized, they enable end-to-end encryptions for every interaction.

How Will Web3.0 Change Future of Social Media?
Web3 will redefine how we socialize. Designed to be community-driven, ad-free, and self-monetized, Web3 is built on blockchain technology where, instead of having large corporations owning all of the content and acting as gatekeepers, it serves as a collective of decentralized networks.

•	Expressing our individuality
Features in Web3 allow users to customize their avatar’s skin, hair and clothes depending on their mood, and you can buy, sell and wear outfits so creative and fantastical they would not be possible to achieve in real life.
•	Re-building sense of community
We will bond over worlds, spaces, and activities in the metaverse. Whether we are attending Burning Man in VR, or we are part of an NFT collection and its associated Discord community, Web3 allows us to reconnect.
•	Giving power back to creators.
